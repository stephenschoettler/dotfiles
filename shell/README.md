# Shell Configurations

## Introduction
This directory contains my shell configurations, primarily for Zsh. These files are designed to enhance the command-line experience, providing custom aliases, functions, and prompt settings for improved productivity.

## Contents
- `.zshrc`: The main configuration file for Zsh, including:
  - Path configurations
  - Aliases for frequently used commands
  - Custom functions
  - Prompt customization
  - Plugin management (e.g., for `oh-my-zsh` or `zinit` if used)

## Getting Started
To use these shell configurations:
1. Ensure you have Zsh installed on your system.
2. Backup your existing `.zshrc` file.
3. Symlink or copy the `.zshrc` from this directory to your home directory (`~/.zshrc`).
4. Restart your terminal or source the `.zshrc` file (`source ~/.zshrc`).

## Customization
Feel free to modify `.zshrc` to suit your personal workflow and preferences.
